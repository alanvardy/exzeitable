Dynamic searchable, sortable datatable that takes a database query and a module, and makes the magic happen. Uses Phoenix Liveview and Postgres. Bootstrap friendly and easily configured for other CSS frameworks.

Documentation can be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/exzeitable](https://hexdocs.pm/exzeitable).

## Installation

This package requires a Postgres database and Phoenix.

The package can be installed by adding [exzeitable](https://github.com/alanvardy/exzeitable) and [Phoenix Live View](https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix_live_view) to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:exzeitable, "~> 0.3.2"},
    {:phoenix_live_view, "~> 0.7"},
    {:floki, ">= 0.0.0", only: :test}
  ]
end
```

Please see Phoenix Live View's installation instructions.

## Getting Started

### Migration

Search requires the `pg_trgm` extension for Postgres.

Create a new migration

```bash
mix ecto.gen.migration add_pg_trgm
```

And add the following code to your migration file

```elixir
  def up do
    execute("CREATE EXTENSION pg_trgm")
  end

  def down do
    execute("DROP EXTENSION pg_trgm")
  end
```

Then migrate

```bash
mix ecto.migrate
```

### Module

Add the boilerplate to a new module.

```elixir
defmodule YourAppWeb.Live.File do
  @moduledoc "User's File table"
  alias YourAppWeb.Router.Helpers, as: Routes
  import Ecto.Query

  use Exzeitable,
    # Required
    repo: YourApp.Repo,
    routes: Routes,
    path: :file_path,
    action_buttons: [:show, :edit, :custom_button]
    query: from(f in File)
    fields: [
      image: [virtual: true],
      title: [hidden: true],
      description: [hidden: true],
      category: [hidden: true],
      filesize: [hidden: true, function: true, search: false],
      inserted_at: [hidden: true, function: true, label: "Created"],
      updated_at: [hidden: true, function: true, label: "Updated"]
    ],
    
    # Optional
    debounce: 300

  # The callback that renders your table
  def render(assigns), do: ~L"<%= build_table(assigns) %>"

  # Field functions, called when virtual: true or function: true
  def image(socket, file) do
    img_tag(file.url, class: "w-100")
    |> link(to: Routes.file_path(socket, :show, file))
  end
  
  # Or heck, lets make another button!
  def super_cool_custom_action(socket, item, csrf_token) do
    link "SUPER AWESOME", to: Routes.super_cool_path(socket, :custom_action, item), "data-confirm": "Are you sure?", csrf_token: csrf_token
  end

  def filesize, do: ...
  def inserted_at, do: ...
  def updated_at, do: ...

```

Options can be added to either your module (as seen above), or in the template (As seen below) or both.
If an option is defined in both the template option will replace the module option. The only exception is `:fields` which must be specified in the module.

#### Required options

  - `repo` The module for your repository. Example: `YourApp.Repo`
  - `routes` Your route module. Example: `YourAppWeb.Router.Helpers`
  - `path` The base path for your resource. Example: `:site_path`
  - `query` A Ecto.Query struct, the part before you give it to the Repo. Example: `from(s in Site, preload: [:users`

#### Defining your fields

Under the fields key, you can define a keyword list of atoms with keyword values. The map holds the options for that field.

```elixir
fields: [
          name: [function: true],
          age: [order: false],
          metadata: [label: "Additional Information", virtual: true, hidden: true],
        ]
```

The following field options are available (with their defaults):

- `label: nil` Set a custom string value for the column heading
- `function: false` Pass (socket, entry) to a function with the same name as the field
- `hidden: false` Hide the column by default (user can click show button to reveal)
- `search: true` Whether to include the column in search results. 
- `order: true` Do not allow the column to be sorted (hide the sort button)
- `virtual: false` This is shorthand for [function: true, search: false, order: false] and will override those settings. Intended for creating fields that are not database backed.
- `deep_search: ["alias.field1", "alias.field2", ...] Add this to perform full-text search on nested associations. Your query must match the aliases used.

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: Search uses [ts_vector](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/datatype-textsearch.html), which is performed by Postgres inside the database on string fields. This means that you cannot search fields that are _not_ string type (i.e. integer, datetime, virtual fields). Make sure to set `search: false` or `virtual: true` on such fields.

Optional... options (with defaults)

  - `action_buttons: [:new, :edit, :show, :delete]` A list of atoms representing action buttons avaliable for the user to use. This does not do authorization, the routes will still be available.
  - `per_page: 20` Integer representing number of entries per page.
  - `debounce: 300` Sets how many miliseconds between responding to user input on the search field. Set in module only
  - `assigns: %{}` Passes additional assigns to socket.assigns. Can only be passed through the template, keep your payload small!

#### Options for nested routes

If you dont know what this is then you likely don't need to worry about it. You can look at [The official docs](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/routing.html#nested-resources) if you would like to learn more.

If you define one of the below options you then need to define the other.

For this example we will be using the boring example of users and posts

```elixir
resources "/users", UserController do
  resources "/posts", PostController
end
```

The users Exzeitable does not need the 2 options below, but the posts Exzeitable does. Because all of its routes are different. The following will be needed to make the posts Exzeitable work:

- `belongs_to: :user`
- `parent: @user`

Make sure that you include the :user_id in your query.

You will need to pass the parent option in from the template.

### Controller

This is where you can specify the query that forms the default data of the table.
Everything the table does is with a subset of this data.

```elixir
query = from(f in Files)
render(conn, "index.html", query: query)
```

### Template

Call the table from your template

```elixir
<h1> My Awesome Files </h1>
<%= YourAppWeb.Live.File.live_table(@conn, query: @query, action_buttons: [:show, :edit], assigns: %{user_id: @current_user.id}) %>
```

### CSS

Almost no CSS styling is included out of the box. I have added generic classes elements in the table in the hopes of making the table as CSS framwork agnostic as possible.

I have included a Bootstrap SASS example in the [CSS Module](https://github.com/alanvardy/exzeitable/blob/develop/CSS.md)
